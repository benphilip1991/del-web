## About
The Digital Enhanced Living (DEL) web service (del-web) is the web management service and one of the user modules for the DEL platform which handles micro health services. The web service is a management portal for administators and caregivers to monitor a user's health status and for managing the services assigned to or being used by the container users. Other services contributing to the platform include [__del-auth__](https://github.com/benphilip1991/del-auth), [__del-container__](https://github.com/benphilip1991/del-container) and [__del-api__](https://github.com/benphilip1991/del-api). More details can be found on their respective pages.  
_Please note that the repositories may be private at the moment and will be made public as they are developed._  
_This component requires the [__del-api__](https://github.com/benphilip1991/del-api) to function. Once launched, the appropriate IP address/hostname and port have to be configured in the environment files (src/environments)._
